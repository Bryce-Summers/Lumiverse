#Cue Light
Cue Light is a lightweight cueing program that demonstrates the use of a Lumiverse
system with a traditional lighting control structure.

Cue Light uses cue lists and provides the ability to record and playback basic cues.
These cues simply have an upfade and downfade time that transitions the lights between
the looks.
